  description: How much genetic recombination occurs in Aspergillus fumigatus? Using a set of whole genome sequenced meiotic progeny, we found that this species has the highest known density of crossovers. The relationship between this recombination rate and the origin of antifungal resistances is a topic of ongoing research.

- title: "The Narrow Footprint of Ancient Balancing Selection Revealed by Heterokaryon Incompatibility Genes in Aspergillus fumigatus"

  description: The scope for genetic interactions between individuals of Aspergillus fumigatus has been unclear. Fusion between individuals is thought to allow heterokaryons to be formed, which can mix genetic information. Here we should that this process is unlikely, and we identify five genes that limit this process. These gene are presumed to trigger cell death, and work is ongoing to better understand the cell death mechanism(s).

  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.
