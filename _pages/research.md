# Research

We are interested in genetic processes in fungi. Often these organisms are seen as "magical" or "mysterious", but in reality they are organisms much like any other. Using both classical genetics as well as advanced genomic methods, we aim to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying many processes occurring in the fungal phyla.

# Non-self recognition

Coming soon

# Antifungal resistance

Coming soon
